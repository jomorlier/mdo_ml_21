## Matlab tutorials on:

 [Complex-step derivatives](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jomorlier/mdocourse/blob/master/ComplexStep/ComplexStep.html)

Estimate derivatives by simply passing in a complex number to your function.
A single (complex) function evaluations computes both the function's value **(Re)** and the derivative **(Im)**.
Is it **always** possible to do this? I mean with a standard code form industry (Nastran, Fluent etc...)?

 [gradient evaluation](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jomorlier/mdocourse/blob/master/Sensibility/sensitivity_TD.html)

Comparison of **Symbolic/Finite Differences/DIRECT/ADJOINT Method** on a really simple mechanical system (2DOFs).
Play with the code for **checking** Symbolic with Finite Differences. Play with $\Delta_x$ ?
By the way, just add the complex step approach, not so difficult when you have access to the **original** code.
Oh, at the end which method is exact? 

 BTW, How Nastran is doing for gradient computation on SOL2OO ?
